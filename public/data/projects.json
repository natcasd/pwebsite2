      "language": ["python"],
      "description": "My group and I applied self-supervised learning techniques to a new domain, flight time series. We used a contrastive learning framework (SIMCLR) to generate latent representations of flight data for use in various downstream tasks like predicting the safety of a flight and determining flight type. We published our novel flight dataset and a corresponding paper to encourage SSL and general ML research in the flight domain.",
